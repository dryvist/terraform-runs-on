# Terraform Command Rules

## Required Command Chain

All terragrunt commands MUST use the full toolchain:

```bash
aws-vault exec tf-runs-on -- doppler run -- terragrunt <COMMAND>
```

## Never Do

- Never run `terragrunt` without `aws-vault` and `doppler` wrapping it
- Never use `--no-session` flag with aws-vault
- Never guess aws-vault profile names — the profile is always `tf-runs-on`
- Never use `--name-transformer` with doppler (that is terraform-proxmox specific)
- Never use raw `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` / `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` env vars
- Never create S3 buckets or DynamoDB tables manually — `terragrunt backend bootstrap` does this

## Claude Code Sessions

When running inside `aws-vault exec tf-runs-on -- claude`, AWS credentials are already
in the environment. Commands only need Doppler:

```bash
doppler run -- terragrunt plan
doppler run -- terragrunt apply
```

Check for inherited credentials: if `AWS_VAULT` env var is set, skip the aws-vault wrapper.

## Doppler Setup

Doppler is configured at the `~/git/` scope (your Doppler config), inherited by all repos.
No per-repo `doppler setup` needed.

The `RUNSON_LICENSE_KEY` env var is mapped to `license_key` via the `inputs` block in `terragrunt.hcl`.

If `doppler run` fails with "no config", check `doppler configure --all` to verify scope inheritance.
